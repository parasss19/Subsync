          <p>
            The Subsync Subscription Manager Chrome Extension is developed by Paras Mehta. For any
            privacy-related questions, you can contact us at{' '}
            <a href='mailto:parasss0708@gmail.com' className='text-gray-200 underline'>support@subsync.com</a>.

          <h2 className='text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2'>3. What Information We Collect and Why</h2>
          <p>
            The Extension is designed with user privacy as a core principle. We do NOT collect, transmit, or store any
            of your personal data on our servers or any external services. All information processed and stored by the
            Extension remains exclusively on your local computer.
          </p>

          <p>The Extension collects and processes the following types of information locally on your device:</p>

          <h1 className='font-bold mt-3'>Subscription Details</h1>
          <ul className='list-disc ml-6 mt-2'>
            <li>
              <strong>What is collected:</strong> Service name (e.g., "Netflix," "Figma"), plan name (e.g., "Premium,"
              "Pro"), billing amount, currency, billing cycle (e.g., monthly, yearly), next renewal date, trial status
              and end date, subscription status (active, cancelling).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>How it&apos;s collected:</strong> This information is extracted directly from the web pages you visit
              (specifically billing, subscription, or membership pages) when you explicitly interact with the Extension
              (e.g., by clicking "Capture with AI").
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Purpose:</strong> To enable the core functionality of the Extension, which is to help you track and
              manage your subscriptions and provide timely renewal reminders. This data is essential for the Extension to
              function as intended.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legal Basis (GDPR):</strong> Performance of a contract (Terms of Service for the Extension) and/or
              legitimate interest (providing you with the requested functionality of subscription management).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h1 className='font-bold mt-3'>Gemini API Key (if provided)</h1>
          <ul className='list-disc ml-6 mt-2'>
            <li>
              <strong>What is collected:</strong> An API key you may provide to enable the "Capture with AI" feature.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>How it&apos;s collected:</strong> You explicitly enter this key into the Extension&apos;s settings page.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Purpose:</strong> To authenticate requests made directly from your browser to Google&apos;s Gemini API
              service, allowing the "Capture with AI" feature to function.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h1 className='font-bold mt-3'>Page Content (for extraction)</h1>
          <ul className='list-disc ml-6 mt-2'>
            <li>
              <strong>What is collected:</strong> The text content and HTML structure of the active web page you are
              viewing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>How it&apos;s collected:</strong> This data is temporarily accessed by the Extension&apos;s content scripts
              only when you explicitly click a "Capture" button. It is processed locally to identify and extract
              subscription details.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Purpose:</strong> To perform the automated subscription detail extraction and categorization.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legal Basis (GDPR):</strong> Performance of a contract (providing you with the requested functionality
              of subscription detail extraction).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

              <strong>Data Portability:</strong> You have the option to export your stored subscription data as a JSON

        <section>
          <h2 className='text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2'>6. Sharing Your Information (No Sharing)</h2>
          <p>
            We do not share, sell, rent, or trade any of your information with third parties. As all data is stored
            locally on your device, there is no sharing of your data by us. If you choose to use the "Capture with AI"
            feature and provide a Gemini API Key, requests are made directly from your browser to Google&apos;s API,
            governed by Google&apos;s own terms of service and privacy policy. We are not involved in this data transfer.

          <h2 className='text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2'>7. Data Retention</h2>
          <p>
            Your data is retained for as long as you keep the Extension installed on your Chrome browser and do not
            explicitly delete the data. We do not have access to your data, so we cannot delete it for you. You are in
            full control of your data retention.
